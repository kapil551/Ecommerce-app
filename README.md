# Learning Redux by building an E-commerce Site

0. Overview:

    - React.js is a libarary that wraps around the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    - React.js only re-renders the component which is being updated by passing props or state update.

    - Redux is a global state management library.

    - Redux prevents the problem of prop drilling.

    - Redux wraps the entire react application with a global store.

    - This global store can be accessed by or updated by any component at any level of the react tree.

    - It also spilts the global store into different "slices".

    - Pull information from global store using "selectors".

    - Push information into the global store using "dispatch action".
